        <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-200">Procrastination is a universal experience. We all know the feeling: a task looms, but instead of tackling it, we scroll, snack, or find anything else to do. But why do we put things off, even when we know it's not in our best interest?</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">At its core, procrastination is not about laziness or poor time management. It's often a way our brains cope with negative emotions—like anxiety, self-doubt, or boredom—associated with a task. When a project feels overwhelming or the outcome uncertain, our mind seeks short-term relief by avoiding it.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">Research in psychology suggests that self-compassion, breaking tasks into smaller steps, and focusing on progress (not perfection) can help us overcome procrastination. Next time you catch yourself delaying, try to notice what you're feeling, and give yourself permission to start small.</p>
